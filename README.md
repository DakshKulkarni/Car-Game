# Car Game

So this is a basic setup to test the car physics and how well it would drive on a mountain which is in the scene, apart from that, there are randomly spawned barriers on the sand and we have to drive maneuvering them, if the car touches, the scene will reload and the game will restart.

The controls are the same old(wasd and arrow keys) to move and steer and space for brakes. The camera follows wherever the car is moving. 

I have used the wheel colliders to determine the movement of the car and rigidbody to define the physics. 

For the main menu, I have added the buttons inspired by the image in the assignment document, but it is not functional, yet it should show how it should be.
